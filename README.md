This repository is directed at Tostan metrics employees to help process the high-volume field data collected using R.
The Cours folder contains files I used to teach the Tostan team how to do R basics, with the Jour_X_etudiant.Rmd files being the unfiled
versions of the exercises for learners to fill in, while the Jour_X.Rmd files are the completed exercises to be used as solution guides.

While these files are meant to get employees up to speed on R, they are very specifically targeted to Tostan data sets (and most of the
comments/instructions are written in French).

The themes of each file are:
 - Jour 2: Data Frames
 - Jour 3: Read/Write data
 - Graphs_du_mois: graph creation using relevant Tostan graphing styles
 - csv_to_spss: an example of how to convert the .csv files Tostan receives from the field to the more useable SPSS format
 
 **The most important file in the Cours folder is the csv_to_spss_instructions file, which is an Rmd/pdf file in both English and French 
 detailing how to write Tostan-relevant csv to spss conversion files**, including the process and usual troubleshooting procedures.
